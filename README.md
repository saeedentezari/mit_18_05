## [Studio1](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/a0e73f587d4bfd20a26147c13c66eeaa_MIT18_05S14_studio1_slides.pdf): Getting started with R, counting, simulation

1. Define `myColMatchs(A, sizematch)` function which checks if an entry was repeated at least `sizematch` times in a column of given 2D array `A`.
It will be used in birthday match problem.

2. Birthday match problem:

    * what is the probability of birthday match of `n` student in a class of size `m`?<br>
    compute the probability by simulation and plot it vs `m` for various `n`'s such as 2, 3, and 4.
    
3. Built-in functions introduced:

    * `sample`, `matrix`, `mean`, `min`, `sum`, `colSums`, `rep`, `seq`, `apply`, `sort`, `which`, `plot`, `lines`, `source`.
